## Notes on Implementation

1. For all percentage-based awards, establish minimum thresholds to avoid edge cases (e.g., someone who bid once and succeeded getting 100%)

2. When counting bids/plays, remember that players alternate between bidding and supporting teams

3. For series play, these statistics should be accumulated across all games in the series

4. Some awards might be withheld if no player meets minimum thresholds

5. Consider tracking "almost won" awards where a player was close to winning multiple categories
