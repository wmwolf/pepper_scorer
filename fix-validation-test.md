# Award Fixes Validation Test

## Test Cases to Verify Fixes

### Test Case 1: Defensive Fortress Award
**Scenario**: Team A sets Team B multiple times, Team B sets Team A fewer times
**Expected**: Team A should win Defensive Fortress award
**Test Hand Sequence**:
- `124CP5` - Team B bids 4♣, plays, 5 tricks → Team A sets Team B (-4 points)
- `235HP4` - Team A bids 5♥, plays, 4 tricks → Team B sets Team A (-5 points)  
- `346NP6` - Team B bids 6♠, plays, 6 tricks → Team A sets Team B (-6 points)
- `14MCP0` - Team A bids Moon♣, plays, 0 tricks → Team B sets Team A (-7 points)
- `126DP5` - Team B bids 6♦, plays, 5 tricks → Team A sets Team B (-6 points)

**Expected Result**: Team A has 3 sets, Team B has 2 sets → Team A wins (if 4+ sets required, neither qualifies)

### Test Case 2: Series MVP Net Points  
**Scenario**: Player with smart folding vs player with failed bids
**Test**: 
- Alice bids 6♠, folds for 2 tricks → Net: +4 points (6-2)
- Bob bids 5♥, plays and goes set → Net: -5 points
- Charlie bids 4♣, succeeds → Net: +4 points  
- Diana bids Moon♦, plays and goes set → Net: -7 points

**Expected Result**: Alice and Charlie tie at +4, or Alice/Charlie win over Bob/Diana

### Test Case 3: Clutch Player Detection
**Scenario**: Team reaches 42+ on specific hand  
**Test Running Scores**:
- After Hand 1: [10, 8]
- After Hand 2: [15, 20] 
- After Hand 3: [25, 32]
- After Hand 4: [38, 35]
- After Hand 5: [45, 35] ← First time over 42

**Expected Result**: Whoever bid Hand 5 gets Clutch Player award

### Test Case 4: Streak Calculation with Defensive Sets
**Scenario**: Defending team sets bidders with 0 tricks
**Test Hands**:
- `124CP3` - Team B succeeds → Team B streak = 1
- `235HP0` - Team A sets Team B (0 tricks but earns points) → Team A streak = 1  
- `346SP2` - Team B succeeds → Team B streak = 1, Team A streak = 0
- `14MNP0` - Team A sets Team B → Team A streak = 1

**Expected Result**: Both teams should have streaks counted correctly including defensive sets

## Manual Testing Instructions

1. **Create Test Game**: Use hands from test cases above
2. **Check Awards**: Verify correct awards are selected  
3. **Check Values**: Ensure point calculations match expected net values
4. **Check Streaks**: Verify longest streaks include defensive wins
5. **Check Edge Cases**: Test with all negative performers, ties, etc.

## Fixed Issues Summary

✅ **Defensive Fortress**: Now counts actual defensive sets, not opponent failures  
✅ **Series MVP**: Uses net points from folding (bid value - tricks given)  
✅ **Series MVP**: Doesn't filter out negative performers  
✅ **Clutch Player**: Properly detects first time over 42 points  
✅ **Streak Calculation**: Includes points from setting bidders  
✅ **Team Indexing**: Uses reliable array index instead of Object.values().indexOf()

## Remaining Issues to Address Later

- Hand completion detection inconsistencies
- Statistics HTML edge cases  
- Award selection fallback logic improvements
- Pepper round edge cases
- Better error handling throughout

The critical calculation errors have been fixed. The awards should now be calculated and assigned correctly!
